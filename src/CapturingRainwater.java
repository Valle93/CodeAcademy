class CapturingRainwater {

    // Create a capturingRainwater() method that takes in an array of heights,
    // and returns the amount of rainwater that could be contained in that array.

    // For example, the array [4, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2] can be represented in the following histogram:
    // Histogram with the Y-axis going from 0 to 4 and the X-axis containing the numbers from the array.
    // Water is pooled in the empty spaces of the histogram, and you can see that it can contain 6 units of water.
    // As you can see, there are 6 units of water that can be contained,
    // so calling capturing_rainwater() on the array [4, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2] should return 6.

    // This challenge was reported to have been asked at interviews with many top companies,
    // including Amazon and Microsoft.
    // If youâ€™ve covered the material in Pass the Technical Interview with Java or an equivalent,
    // you should be able to solve this challenge. If you have trouble,
    // try refreshing your knowledge with its Capturing Rainwater walkthrough.
